  - "Our airship is destroyed! Scavenge the planet for wreckage\u2014we need parts
    to rebuild. But hurry\u2026 in 5 days, the sky will explode, and we\u2019ll be
    wiped out!"
  - "Send your robots to collect materials from crashed ships. Metal, circuits, fuel\u2014everything
    helps. The more we gather, the faster we can escape!"
  - Take materials to the Recycler to break them down. Then, use the Crafter to turn
    them into tools, robot upgrades, or ship parts. Recycle wisely!
  - "Build more robots! The more workers you have, the faster you can mine, craft,
    and defend. Protect them\u2014losing bots means losing time!"
  - "Watch out\u2014hostile creatures lurk in the ruins! Your Combat Bot will fight
    them off, but don\u2019t take unnecessary risks. Survival comes first!"
  - Focus on fixing the airship! Collect enough mechanisms to repair the engine,
    hull, and navigation systems. Every part brings us closer to escape!
  - "Time is running out! The sky grows unstable. Work fast, prioritize wisely, and
    get us off this planet before it\u2019s too late!"
